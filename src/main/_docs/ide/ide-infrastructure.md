To discover what servers are connected to specific developer machine in runtime you can click to Server item in context menu called from the console panel:

![server-info-context-menu.jpg]({{base}}{{site.links["server-info-context-menu.jpg"]}})

Then you will be able to preview the whole list of bound servers:

![server-info-whole-list.jpg]({{base}}{{site.links["server-info-whole-list.jpg"]}})

Server tab displays a list of user predefined and internal servers. To display user only servers just switch the check box in the upper right corner:

![server-info-switch-display-mode.jpg]({{base}}{{site.links["server-info-switch-display-mode.jpg"]}})
